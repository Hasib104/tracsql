Description
===========

The TracSQL project is a plugin for the Trac project management tool.

A "SQL" tab is added to the Trac project.  Inside this tab, the plugin
supports interacting with the project database.

Some features include:

* perform queries on the project database
* view results as raw or formatted (and hyper-linked) output
* export result set in CSV
* browse the database schema (including table and index information)

This plugin supports Trac installations with SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL
database backends (although the queries will need to be written differently
according to which SQL database is being used).


Installation
============

The TracSQL plugin can be installed using standard::

    python setup.py install


Configuration
=============

It is configured in the trac.ini file by enabling and configuring::

    [components]
    tracsql.* = enabled

The TRAC_ADMIN permission is used to control access to the query pages.
