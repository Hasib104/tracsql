Description
===========

The TracSQL project is a plugin for the 'trac' project management tool.

A "SQL" tab is added to the trac project.  Inside this tab SQL queries can be
performed on the project database.

This plugin supports Trac installations with SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL
database backends (although the queries will need to be written differently
according to which SQL database is being used).


Installation
============

The TracSQL plugin can be installed using standard::

    python setup.py install


Configuration
=============

It is configured in the trac.ini file by enabling and configuring::

    [components]
    tracsql.* = enabled

The TRAC_ADMIN permission is used to control access to the query pages.
