Description
===========

The 'tracsql' project is a plugin for the 'trac' project management tool.

The 'tracsql' plugin adds a "SQL" tab to the trac project.  Inside this
tab SQL queries can be performed on the project database.

The 'tracsql' plugin supports Trac installations with SQLite, MySQL, and
PostgreSQL database backends (although the queries will need to be written
differently according to which SQL database is being used).


Installation

The 'tracsql' plugin can be installed using standard::

    python setup.py install


Configuration
=============

It is configured in the trac.ini file by enabling and configuring::

    [components]
    tracsql.* = enabled

The TRAC_ADMIN permission is used to control access to the query pages.
